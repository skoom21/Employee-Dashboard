## Project Overview

This project is a small part of our larger HRMS/Grievance system. Your task is to build the Employee Dashboard using the tools and practices outlined below. The goal is to assess your ability to implement effective UI/UX design and utilize the technologies we use in our main project.

## Optional: Figma Design
Before you start coding, You could layout your plans for the dashboard using figma or any other design tool. This will help you visualize the layout and design of the dashboard and will be seen as plus points for your submission.

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Next.js**: React framework for building the application.
2. **ShadCN UI**: Component library for building reusable and accessible UI components.

## Design Guidelines

### 1. UI/UX Practices

- Maintain a consistent and clean design.
- Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Prioritize accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Follow the modern design trends (minimalism, proper spacing, readable fonts).

### 2. Color and Theme

Use the colors and styles defined in `globals.css`. This ensures consistency with our existing project.

### 3. ShadCN UI

- Refer to the [ShadCN UI Documentation](https://shadcn.dev/) for guidance.
